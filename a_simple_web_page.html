      <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com/course_catalog">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?</p> 

      <p class="more-text">There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the &quot;class&quot; attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accompish that.</p>

      <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">This is the final paragraph. It also uses the &prime;class&prime; attribute as well as an &prime;id&prime; attribute. We'll use some CSS and the &prime;id&prime; attribute to underline the entire paragraph.</p>
